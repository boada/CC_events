# List of all public events from [Conflict Chamber](http://conflictchamber.com)

## Last Updated: November 13, 2019

 I am planning to update the lists about once a month.

There are two lists available.

1. [Events sorted by Event ID](https://github.com/boada/CC_events/blob/master/evts_uid.md)

2. [Events sorted by Date](https://github.com/boada/CC_events/blob/master/evts_date.md)


The two lists provide the Event ID with a link to the [Conflict Chamber](http://conflictchamber.com) lists, the event name with link (if available) to the original event page, the number of players (if lists are public), and whether or not the event is a team event.

## How can you help?

If you see an obvious mistake, please let me know by opening an issue or a pull request. I've not edited anything by hand, so I am sure there are issues.

I'll do my best to update the lists from time to time. If you want to see lists from a specific event, and the number of players is missing from this list, please talk to the event organizers and get the lists published. You could also contact the maintainers of [Conflict Chamber](http://conflictchamber.com) asking to have the event made public. Both approaches will help make these lists more complete, providing a better overview of the meta throughout time.

If you want to help do some analysis feel free to contact me. I've hidden the actual scripts which fetch the data from [Conflict Chamber](http://conflictchamber.com) because there is no point banging on the website more than we need to, but I'm happy to hear suggestions.

## Future plans

I am gonna look into getting geographical info (when available). Hopefully that will help people who are planning to travel to different metas get a sense of what is being playing in different regions of the world.
